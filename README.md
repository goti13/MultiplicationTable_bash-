## Bash Script For Generating a Multiplication Table

# Objective: 

- To create Bash script that generates a multiplication table for a number entered by the user. This project
is to help me practice using loops, handling user input, and applying conditional logic in Bash scripting.
# Project Description
- The script should prompt the user to enter a number and then ask if they prefer to see a full multiplication table from 1 to 10 or a partial table within a specified range. Based on the user's choice, the script will display the corresponding multiplication table.
# Project Requirements
- User Input for Number: The script must first ask the user to input a number for which the multiplication table will be generated.

# Project Output

- Below is an example output for full multiplication
